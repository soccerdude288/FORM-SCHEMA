# AI Session Notes - June 9, 2025

## Summary of Changes Completed

This session successfully addressed the key issues with the schema system to support multi-step rules, sliding scale calculations, and signature field behavior.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced Interface Types

**File:** `appApiFiles/schemas/formSchemaInterfaces.ts`

- Added `CALCULATED` field type for computed values
- Added `MAKE_NON_EDITABLE` action type for signature workflow
- Created generic calculation system with multiple types:
  - `RANGE_LOOKUP` (for sliding scale)
  - `FORMULA` (for mathematical expressions)
  - `VALUE_LOOKUP` (for direct mappings)
  - `CONDITIONAL` (for if-then logic)
- Added `PropertyMapping` interface for dynamic rule field mappings
- Enhanced `Action` interface with `propertyMappings` and `calculation` properties

### 2. Improved MAR Schema

**File:** `appApiFiles/schemas/marSchema.ts`

- Fixed vitals visibility rule to use `dynamicValues.whatVitals` with `propertyMappings`
- Corrected field references to use proper `vitals.` prefix
- Added calculated field for sliding scale dose
- Fixed dynamic rules to reference `selectedException` instead of `exceptions`
- Added rule for making fields non-editable when signature is present
- Added sliding scale visibility rule

### 3. Updated Documentation

**File:** `SCHEMA-DOCS.md`

- Added documentation for `CALCULATED` field type
- Documented signature field special behavior
- Added comprehensive calculation system documentation
- Explained `MAKE_NON_EDITABLE` action type
- Updated dynamic rule examples with new syntax

## Technical Implementation Details

### Generic Calculation System

The sliding scale is now implemented using a generic `RANGE_LOOKUP` calculation type:

```typescript
calculation: {
  type: CalculationType.RANGE_LOOKUP,
  rangeLookup: {
    inputField: "vitals.glucose",
    ranges: [],  // Populated from dynamicValues.slidingScale.start
    values: [],  // Populated from dynamicValues.slidingScale.doses
    defaultValue: "No dose recommended"
  }
}
```

This approach allows for:
- Sliding scale calculations (current use case)
- Future formula-based calculations
- Value lookup tables
- Conditional logic

### Multi-Step Vitals Rules

The vitals system now properly supports:

1. **Dynamic Visibility:** `dynamicValues.whatVitals` array controls which vital fields are shown
2. **Conditional Requirements:** Only visible vitals can be required
3. **Exception-based Rules:** Exception properties (`vitalsRequired`, `noteRequired`, `medDestruction`) drive requirements

### Signature Field Behavior

Implemented proper signature workflow:
- Signature fields show capture interface when empty
- Display timestamp when signed (from API payload)
- Other fields become non-editable when signature exists

## Data Flow Understanding

### API Response Structure
The API returns medication entries with:
```json
{
  "dynamicValues": {
    "exceptions": [...],     // Options for selectedException field
    "whatVitals": [...],     // Controls vital field visibility  
    "slidingScale": {...}    // Controls sliding scale calculation
  }
}
```

### Field Mapping
- `dynamicValues.whatVitals` maps to vital field visibility via `propertyMappings`
- Exception selection triggers rules based on exception properties
- Sliding scale data populates calculation configuration

## Issues Resolved

1. ✅ **Multi-step vitals rules** - Now properly implemented with dynamic visibility and conditional requirements
2. ✅ **Sliding scale calculations** - Generic calculation system supports range-based lookups
3. ✅ **Signature field behavior** - Fields become non-editable after signing
4. ✅ **Dynamic rule structure** - Fixed field references and property mappings
5. ✅ **Documentation updates** - Complete documentation of new features

## For Future Sessions

### What's Working
- Schema interfaces support all required functionality
- MAR schema properly implements business rules
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

### Potential Areas for Enhancement
1. **Validation System:** Could add validation for calculation configurations
2. **Rule Dependencies:** Could implement rule dependency checking
3. **Performance:** Could optimize rule processing for large forms
4. **Testing:** Could add comprehensive test cases for new rule types

### Implementation Notes
- The generic calculation system is extensible for future needs
- Dynamic rules now properly handle both array-based and object-based conditions
- Signature workflow follows healthcare industry standards

## Files Modified
- `appApiFiles/schemas/formSchemaInterfaces.ts` - Enhanced interfaces
- `appApiFiles/schemas/marSchema.ts` - Fixed implementation
- `SCHEMA-DOCS.md` - Updated documentation

All changes maintain backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities for complex healthcare form workflows.
